# CafeFlow System Design

A comprehensive cafe management system designed using PlantUML diagrams to visualize the complete architecture and workflow of a modern cafe operation.

## 📋 Overview

CafeFlow is a complete cafe management system that handles all aspects of cafe operations, from customer authentication to order management and inventory tracking. This repository contains detailed system design diagrams that illustrate the relationships and workflows between different components.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is modularly designed with the following core components:

- **Authentication System** - User login, registration, and session management
- **Menu Management** - Product catalog, pricing, and menu updates
- **Order Management** - Order processing, status tracking, and fulfillment
- **Inventory Management** - Stock tracking, alerts, and supplier management

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and edit these PlantUML diagrams, you'll need:

- **PlantUML**: Download from [plantuml.com](https://plantuml.com/starting)
- **VS Code** (optional): With PlantUML extension for live preview
- **Online Editor**: Use [PlantUML Online Server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) for quick viewing

### Viewing the Diagrams

1. **Individual Components**: Navigate to the `diagrams/` folder to view specific system components
2. **Complete System**: Open `cafeflow_master.puml` to see the entire system architecture
3. **Online Viewing**: Copy the content of any `.puml` file and paste it into the PlantUML online server

### Editing Diagrams

1. Clone this repository
2. Install PlantUML on your system
3. Open any `.puml` file in your preferred editor
4. Make modifications and regenerate the diagrams

## 📊 System Components

### Authentication System
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password recovery

### Menu Management
- Product catalog management
- Dynamic pricing
- Category organization
- Availability tracking

### Order Management
- Order creation and processing
- Status tracking
- Payment integration
- Order history

### Inventory Management
- Stock level monitoring
- Low stock alerts
- Supplier management
- Receiving and adjustments

## 🔄 Relationships

The system components interact through well-defined relationships:

- **Users** can have multiple **Orders**
- **Orders** contain multiple **MenuItems**
- **Inventory** tracks **MenuItem** stock levels
- **Authentication** secures all system operations

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Payment gateway integration
- [ ] Reporting and analytics module
- [ ] Customer loyalty program
- [ ] Multi-location support
- [ ] Mobile application design
- [ ] Real-time notifications system

## 📝 Documentation

Each diagram includes detailed comments explaining the system flows and component interactions. Refer to the individual `.puml` files for specific implementation details.
